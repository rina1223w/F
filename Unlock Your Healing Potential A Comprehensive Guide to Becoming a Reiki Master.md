The Reiki system is typically divided into three main levels, with the Master level often further subdivided. Each level builds upon the previous one, deepening your understanding and ability to channel Reiki energy.

*   **Reiki Level 1 (Shoden - "First Teaching"):** This introductory level focuses on self-healing. You'll learn the history of Reiki, the basic hand positions for treating yourself and others, and the fundamental principles of Reiki. You'll receive an attunement that opens your energy channels, allowing you to channel Reiki energy. The emphasis is on experiencing Reiki firsthand and developing a daily self-healing practice.

You'll learn the Master symbol, which further enhances your ability to channel Reiki energy. The focus is on deepening your spiritual understanding of Reiki and using it for personal growth and transformation. Some teachers combine this with the teaching level (3B).

*   **Reiki Level 3B (Reiki Master Teacher):** This is the final level of Reiki training. You'll learn how to attune others to Reiki, enabling you to teach and share the gift of Reiki with others. This level requires a significant commitment to Reiki and a deep understanding of its principles.
