**Understanding Naturopathy: Core Principles**

Naturopathy is guided by six core principles that inform its practice:

1.  **The Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medicatrix Naturae):** Naturopaths believe the body has an inherent ability to heal itself.  Their role is to support and stimulate this natural healing process.

2.  **Identify and Treat the Cause (Tolle Causam):**  Instead of simply suppressing symptoms, naturopaths seek to identify and address the underlying causes of illness. This often involves exploring factors like diet, lifestyle, stress, and environmental exposures.

3.  **First Do No Harm (Primum Non Nocere):**  Naturopathic practitioners prioritize the use of therapies that are safe and effective, minimizing the risk of side effects. They utilize the least invasive methods possible.

4.  **Treat the Whole Person (Tolle Totum):**  Naturopathy recognizes that health is influenced by physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual factors. Treatment plans are tailored to address the individual's unique needs and circumstances.

5.  **Doctor as Teacher (Docere):**  Naturopaths educate their patients about health and wellness, empowering them to take an active role in their own healing.  They provide guidance on diet, lifestyle, and self-care practices.

6.  **Prevention is the Best Cure (Preventare):**  Naturopathy emphasizes preventative measures to maintain health and prevent illness. This includes promoting healthy habits, such as a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management techniques.
