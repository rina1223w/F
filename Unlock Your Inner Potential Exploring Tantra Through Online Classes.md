## What is Tantra? Debunking the Myths

Before diving into the world of online classes, it's crucial to understand what Tantra truly is. Often misrepresented in popular culture, Tantra is far more than just a focus on sexuality. At its core, Tantra is a spiritual practice that emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things. It's a path of embracing the totality of human experience, including the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual aspects of ourselves.

Tantra views the universe as a manifestation of divine energy, and seeks to awaken and harness this energy within ourselves. This is often achieved through practices like meditation, breathwork (pranayama), visualization, mantra chanting, and ritual. While sexuality is acknowledged as a powerful life force in Tantra, it's just one element within a much broader framework.
