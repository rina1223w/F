## Understanding the Pashto Language

Pashto is an Eastern Iranian language belonging to the Indo-European family. It's closely related to other Iranian languages such as Persian and Kurdish. Here are some key features of the Pashto language:

*   **Script:** Pashto uses a modified version of the Arabic script, with additional letters to represent sounds unique to the language. The script is written from right to left.

*   **Phonology:** Pashto has a complex phonological system with a wide range of consonants and vowels, including sounds that may be unfamiliar to speakers of English or other European languages.

*   **Grammar:** Pashto grammar is generally SOV (Subject-Object-Verb), and it features a relatively complex system of noun and verb inflections. Pashto is also an ergative language, meaning that the subject of a transitive verb is marked differently from the subject of an intransitive verb.

*   **Dialects:** Pashto has several regional dialects, which can differ significantly in pronunciation and vocabulary. The two main dialect groups are Northern Pashto and Southern Pashto.
