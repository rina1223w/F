## What is eBay Arbitrage?

At its core, eBay arbitrage involves sourcing products from one location (typically online retailers) and selling them for a higher price on eBay.  The price difference, minus fees and shipping costs, is your profit.  This can include retail arbitrage (finding discounted items in brick-and-mortar stores), online arbitrage (sourcing from other online retailers), or even wholesale arbitrage (buying in bulk from wholesalers).

The key to successful eBay arbitrage is identifying products with sufficient demand and a significant price discrepancy.  This can be a time-consuming process if done manually, requiring hours of searching and comparing prices across multiple platforms.  This is precisely where arbitrage software shines.

## Why You Need Arbitrage Software for eBay

Manually searching for profitable products on eBay is like searching for a needle in a haystack. Arbitrage software automates this process, saving you time and increasing your chances of finding winning products. Here's a breakdown of the key benefits:
