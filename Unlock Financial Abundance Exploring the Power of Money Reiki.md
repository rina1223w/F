## What is Money Reiki?

Money Reiki is a specialized branch of Reiki that focuses specifically on the energetic connection between individuals and money.  Traditional Reiki works by channeling universal life force energy to heal physical, emotional, and spiritual imbalances. Money Reiki takes this concept a step further by targeting the negative beliefs, emotional baggage, and energetic blockages that can hinder our financial well-being.

Think of money as energy â€“ it flows in and out of our lives based on our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs about it.  Negative beliefs such as "money is the root of all evil," "I'm not good with money," or "I don't deserve to be rich" can create energetic dams that prevent money from flowing freely into our lives. Money Reiki aims to dissolve these dams, clearing the path for financial abundance to manifest.

## How Does Money Reiki Work?

Money Reiki works by addressing the energetic root causes of financial scarcity. It involves a combination of techniques, including:

*   **Attunements:** Money Reiki masters attune practitioners to specific symbols and energies that are associated with wealth and abundance. These attunements amplify the practitioner's ability to channel money-related energies.

*   **Symbols:** Specific Money Reiki symbols are used to focus and direct the energy towards specific financial goals. These symbols act as energetic keys, unlocking the flow of abundance.

*   **Affirmations:**  Positive affirmations are used to reprogram the subconscious mind with empowering beliefs about money. By repeatedly affirming our worthiness and deservingness of wealth, we can shift our energetic vibration to attract abundance.

*   **Visualization:** Visualization techniques involve creating mental images of ourselves living in financial abundance. These images help to solidify our intentions and attract the desired outcomes into our reality.

*   **Energy Clearing:**  Money Reiki practitioners use energy clearing techniques to remove negative energies and blockages that are hindering the flow of money. This may involve clearing limiting beliefs, past traumas, or negative karmic patterns related to finances.

*   **Gratitude:**  Expressing gratitude for what we already have is a powerful way to attract more abundance into our lives. Money Reiki encourages practitioners to cultivate an attitude of gratitude for the blessings they receive.
