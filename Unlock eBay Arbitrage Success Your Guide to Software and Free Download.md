## What is Arbitrage Software for eBay?

Arbitrage software for eBay is designed to automate and streamline the process of identifying profitable product opportunities. It typically involves scanning various online retailers and marketplaces to identify products selling for less than their average selling price on eBay. The software can then help with listing these products on eBay, tracking price fluctuations, managing inventory, and even automating order fulfillment.

## Beyond the Software: Mastering eBay Arbitrage Strategies
