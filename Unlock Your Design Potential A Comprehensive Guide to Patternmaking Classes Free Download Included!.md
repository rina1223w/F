## What is Patternmaking?

Patternmaking is the process of creating a template, or pattern, from which the parts of a garment are cut. These patterns are essentially maps that guide the sewer in constructing the garment according to the designer's vision. A well-made pattern is the foundation of a well-fitting and well-constructed garment.

There are several methods of patternmaking, each with its own advantages and disadvantages:

*   **Drafting:** This method involves creating patterns from scratch using body measurements and mathematical formulas. It's a precise and highly customizable approach, allowing for the creation of unique designs tailored to specific individuals.

*   **Draping:** Also known as "modeling on the stand," draping involves manipulating fabric directly on a dress form to create the desired shape and silhouette. The fabric is then marked, cut, and used as a template for creating a pattern. This method is particularly useful for designing garments with complex shapes or unusual drapes.

*   **Flat Patternmaking:** This is the most common method, where patterns are developed on a flat surface using pre-existing blocks or slopers (basic pattern shapes that fit the body well). Adjustments and alterations are made to these blocks to create new designs.

## Why Take Patternmaking Classes?

While it might seem tempting to try and learn patternmaking from books or online tutorials, taking structured patternmaking classes offers several significant advantages:

*   **Expert Guidance:** A qualified instructor can provide personalized feedback and guidance, helping you avoid common mistakes and develop good patternmaking habits. They can also answer your specific questions and offer tailored solutions to your design challenges.

*   **Structured Learning:** Patternmaking classes typically follow a well-defined curriculum, ensuring that you learn the fundamentals in a logical and progressive manner. This systematic approach helps you build a solid foundation of knowledge and skills.

*   **Hands-on Practice:** Patternmaking is a practical skill that requires hands-on practice. Classes provide ample opportunities to work on real-world projects and experiment with different techniques under the supervision of an experienced instructor.

*   **Access to Resources:** Patternmaking classes often provide access to specialized tools, equipment, and materials that you might not have at home. This can significantly enhance your learning experience and allow you to explore more advanced techniques.

*   **Networking Opportunities:** Taking patternmaking classes can connect you with other aspiring designers and industry professionals. This can lead to valuable networking opportunities, collaborations, and even job prospects.

## What to Expect in a Patternmaking Class

Patternmaking classes vary in content and format depending on the level and focus of the course. However, most classes will cover the following topics:

*   **Basic Patternmaking Tools and Equipment:** You'll learn about essential tools like rulers, curves, tracing wheels, and pattern paper, as well as how to use them effectively.

*   **Body Measurements and Fitting:** Accurate body measurements are crucial for creating well-fitting garments. You'll learn how to take accurate measurements and how to use them to create patterns that fit properly.

*   **Understanding Grainlines and Fabric Properties:** Understanding how fabric behaves is essential for patternmaking. You'll learn about grainlines, bias, and different fabric properties and how they affect the drape and fit of a garment.

*   **Dart Manipulation and Seam Allowances:** Darts and seam allowances are fundamental elements of patternmaking. You'll learn how to manipulate darts to create different shapes and how to add appropriate seam allowances for construction.

*   **Developing Basic Blocks (Slopers):** You'll learn how to draft or adapt basic blocks for different garment types, such as skirts, bodices, and sleeves.

*   **Pattern Alteration and Grading:** You'll learn how to alter existing patterns to fit different body shapes and sizes, as well as how to grade patterns up or down to create a range of sizes.

*   **Specific Garment Construction:** Some classes may focus on specific garment constructions, such as dresses, pants, or jackets, providing hands-on experience in creating patterns for these garments.

## Types of Patternmaking Classes

Patternmaking classes are offered in a variety of formats to suit different learning styles and schedules:

*   **In-Person Classes:** These classes offer the most immersive learning experience, with direct interaction with the instructor and other students. They typically involve hands-on practice and group projects.

*   **Online Classes:** Online classes offer flexibility and convenience, allowing you to learn at your own pace and from anywhere in the world. They often include video lectures, interactive exercises, and online forums for discussion.

*   **Workshops:** Workshops are short, intensive courses that focus on specific patternmaking techniques or garment constructions. They are a great way to learn new skills quickly and efficiently.

*   **Certificate Programs:** Certificate programs offer a more comprehensive and structured learning experience, leading to a recognized qualification in patternmaking.

## Choosing the Right Patternmaking Class

Choosing the right patternmaking class is essential for a successful learning experience. Consider the following factors when making your decision:

*   **Your Skill Level:** Choose a class that is appropriate for your current skill level. If you're a beginner, start with a foundational course that covers the basics.

*   **Your Learning Style:** Consider your preferred learning style. If you prefer hands-on practice, choose an in-person class. If you prefer flexibility, choose an online class.

*   **The Instructor's Qualifications:** Look for an instructor with extensive experience in patternmaking and a proven track record of teaching success.

*   **The Curriculum:** Review the curriculum carefully to ensure that it covers the topics that you're interested in learning.
