## What is Thai Massage?

Unlike Western massage, which primarily focuses on muscles, Thai massage works with the body's energy lines, known as "Sen." Practitioners use their hands, elbows, knees, and feet to apply pressure along these lines, stimulating energy flow and releasing blockages. The recipient remains fully clothed and lies on a mat on the floor.

Thai massage sessions often resemble a choreographed dance, with the practitioner guiding the recipient through a series of yoga-like stretches and postures. This combination of acupressure and assisted stretching helps to:

*   **Release muscle tension and stiffness:** The deep pressure and stretching loosen tight muscles and improve flexibility.
*   **Improve circulation:** The pressure applied along the Sen lines stimulates blood flow, delivering oxygen and nutrients to the tissues.
*   **Increase energy levels:** By clearing energy blockages, Thai massage revitalizes the body and mind.
*   **Reduce stress and anxiety:** The combination of physical and energetic release promotes relaxation and reduces stress hormones.
*   **Improve posture and alignment:** The assisted stretching and postural adjustments help to correct imbalances and improve overall body alignment.
