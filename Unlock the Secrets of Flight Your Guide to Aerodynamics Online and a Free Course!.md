## What to Expect in an Online Aerodynamics Course

A comprehensive online aerodynamics course typically covers a range of topics, providing a solid foundation in the fundamental principles of fluid dynamics and their application to various engineering problems. Here's a breakdown of common topics:

*   **Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics:** This section introduces the basic concepts of fluid properties, fluid statics, and fluid dynamics. You'll learn about concepts like pressure, density, viscosity, and surface tension.
*   **Fluid Kinematics:** This area focuses on the motion of fluids without considering the forces involved. You'll learn about streamlines, pathlines, streaklines, and various flow patterns.
*   **Fluid Dynamics:** Here, you'll delve into the relationship between fluid motion and the forces acting on the fluid. Key concepts include Bernoulli's equation, Euler's equation, and the Navier-Stokes equations.
*   **Boundary Layer Theory:** This crucial concept explains the thin layer of fluid near a solid surface where viscous effects are dominant. Understanding boundary layers is essential for analyzing drag and lift.
*   **Airfoil Theory:** This section focuses specifically on the aerodynamic characteristics of airfoils, the shapes of airplane wings. You'll learn about lift, drag, stall, and other important concepts.
*   **Wing Theory:** Expanding on airfoil theory, this section explores the aerodynamic behavior of wings, including aspects like wingtip vortices, induced drag, and wing planform design.
*   **Compressible Flow:** This advanced topic deals with the behavior of fluids at high speeds, where density changes become significant. You'll learn about shock waves, Mach number, and other related concepts.
*   **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD):** Many online courses introduce CFD, a powerful tool for simulating fluid flows using computers. You'll learn about the basics of CFD and how to use it to solve practical problems.

## Choosing the Right Online Aerodynamics Course

With the growing popularity of online learning, there are many aerodynamics courses to choose from. Here are some factors to consider when making your selection:
