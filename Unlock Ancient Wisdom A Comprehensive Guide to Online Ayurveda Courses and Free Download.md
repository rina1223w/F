*   **Vikriti (Imbalance):** Deviation from your natural constitution, often leading to health issues.
*   **Diet and Nutrition:** Ayurvedic principles emphasize eating according to your dosha and the seasons.
*   **Lifestyle Practices:** Yoga, meditation, pranayama (breathwork), and daily routines are integral parts of Ayurvedic healing.
